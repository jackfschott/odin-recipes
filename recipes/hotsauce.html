    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the hot sauce we’ve been swooning over for months now and could hardly wait to share with you all! It’s adapted from the Mango Habanero Hot Sauce from the Afro-Vegan cookbook by Bryant Terry (a book we’re huge fans of!). We love the original recipe and have been paring it down for ease without sacrificing on heat.
        If you love hot sauce and mangoes, this is a must-try. The color is vibrant, the flavor is a delicate balance of spicy, sweet, and tart, and it’s so versatile and delicious on just about everything (plantains anyone?). Plus, it comes together in 25 minutes with just 8 simple ingredients. Let’s make hot sauce!</p>
